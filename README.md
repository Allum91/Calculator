# Calculator
My first project with _nology. Made a functional calculator using HTML SCSS and Javascript.

## How to use
Choose any number to multiply, divide, add, subtract or find the percentage of. C to clear and the backspace to delete last digit.

## Testing 
I have used cypress to test my calculator. All tests have passed.
